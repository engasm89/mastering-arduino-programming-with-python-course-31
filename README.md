## Overview

Receive commands from Python over serial to control hardware on Arduino. This example turns the onboard LED on and off via simple text commands.

## Code Explained

- Buffers text input and parses `ON` or `OFF` commands.
- Acknowledges actions with `OK ON` / `OK OFF` or `ERR`.

## How To Use

- Send lines from Python using `pyserial`: `ser.write(b"ON\n")` or `ser.write(b"OFF\n")`.
- Observe acknowledgments and LED behavior.
